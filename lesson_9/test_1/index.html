                This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was
                travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve
                thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its
                cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The
                buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and
                then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting
                them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living
                flesh which no dam could contain.

                The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the
                platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to
                be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically
                until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and
                longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.
